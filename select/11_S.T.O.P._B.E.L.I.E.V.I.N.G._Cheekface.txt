Looking at my phone in the bookstore when it appeared to me
Rare footage never before seen by a significant girlfriend
And I'm not gonna call it innovation
But I'm not gonna call it anything else either
Thanks for the invite, but I'm too not going

I work on forgetting today and every day
I suck at something today and every day
It looks like roadkill, and I mean in a good way
Almost always, every day

Waiting in line at the juice bar when it occurred to me
I may be too fat to be Spider-Man
But not to be Body Positive Spider-Man!
All day I dream about self-improvement
Capitalism, deregulation and eating a bagel
Thanks for the invite, but I'm too not going

I work on forgetting today and every day
I suck at something today and every day
It looks like roadkill, and I mean in a good way
Almost always, every day

S-T-O-P-B-E-L-I-E-V-I-N-G
S-T-O-P-B-E-L-I-E-V-I-N-G
S-T-O-P-B-E-L-I-E-V-I-N-G
S-T-O-P-B-E-L-I-E-V-I-N-G

I work on forgetting today and every day
I suck at something today and every day
It looks like roadkill, and I mean in a good way
Almost always, every day
